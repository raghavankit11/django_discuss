However, these interesting and delicious crustaceans are very much\r\nworth considering. Their nervous systems are comparatively simple, with large,\r\neasily observable neurons, the magic cells of the brain. Because of this, scientists\r\nhave been able to map the neural circuitry of lobsters very accurately. This has\r\nhelped us understand the structure and function of the brain and behaviour of\r\nmore complex animals, including human beings. Lobsters have more in common\r\nwith you than you might think (particularly when you are feeling crabby\u2014ha\r\nha).\r\nLobsters live on the ocean floor. They need a home base down there, a range\r\nwithin which they hunt for prey and scavenge around for stray edible bits and\r\npieces of whatever rains down from the continual chaos of carnage and death far\r\nabove. They want somewhere secure, where the hunting and the gathering is\r\ngood. They want a home.\r\nThis can present a problem, since there are many lobsters. What if two of\r\nthem occupy the same territory, at the bottom of the ocean, at the same time, and\r\nboth want to live there? What if there are hundreds of lobsters, all trying to make\r\na living and raise a family, in the same crowded patch of sand and refuse?",

        "content": "The town I grew up in had been scraped only fifty years earlier out of the endless\r\nflat Northern prairie. Fairview, Alberta, was part of the frontier, and had the\r\ncowboy bars to prove it. The Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. department store on Main Street\r\nstill bought beaver, wolf and coyote furs directly from the local trappers. Three\r\nthousand people lived there, four hundred miles away from the nearest city.\r\nCable TV, video games and internet did not exist. It was no easy matter to stay\r\ninnocently amused in Fairview, particularly during the five months of winter,\r\nwhen long stretches of forty-below days and even colder nights were the norm.\r\nThe world is a different place when it\u2019s cold like that. The drunks in our town\r\nended their sad lives early. They passed out in snowbanks at three in the morning\r\nand froze to death. You don\u2019t go outside casually when it\u2019s forty below. On first\r\nbreath, the arid desert air constricts your lungs. Ice forms on your eyelashes and\r\nthey stick together. Long hair, wet from the shower, freezes solid and then stands\r\non end wraith-like of its own accord later in a warm house, when it thaws bone\r\ndry, charged with electricity. Children only put their tongues on steel playground\r\nequipment once. Smoke from house chimneys doesn\u2019t rise. Defeated by the cold,\r\nit drifts downwards, and collects like fog on snow-covered rooftops and yards.\r\nCars must be plugged in at night, their engines warmed by block heaters, or oil\r\nwill not flow through them in the morning, and they won\u2019t start. Sometimes they\r\nwon\u2019t anyway. Then you turn the engine over pointlessly until the starter clattersand falls silent. Then you remove the frozen battery from the car, loosening bolts\r\nwith stiffening fingers in the intense cold, and bring it into the house. It sits\r\nthere, sweating for hours, until it warms enough to hold a decent charge. You are\r\nnot going to see out of the back window of your car, either. It frosts over in\r\nNovember and stays that way until May. Scraping it off just dampens the\r\nupholstery. Then it\u2019s frozen, too. Late one night going to visit a friend I sat for\r\ntwo hours on the edge of the passenger seat in a 1970 Dodge Challenger,\r\njammed up against the stick-shift, using a vodka-soaked rag to keep the inside of\r\nthe front windshield clear in front of the driver because the car heater had quit.\r\nStopping wasn\u2019t an option. There was nowhere to stop",

Some Mafia don has a tackier\r\nyacht. Some obsessive CEO has a more complicated self-winding watch, kept inhis more valuable mechanical hardwood-and-steel automatic self-winding watch\r\ncase. Even the most stunning Hollywood actress eventually transforms into the\r\nEvil Queen, on eternal, paranoid watch for the new Snow White. And you? Your\r\ncareer is boring and pointless, your housekeeping skills are second-rate, your\r\ntaste is appalling, you\u2019re fatter than your friends, and everyone dreads your\r\nparties. Who cares if you are prime minister of Canada when someone else is the\r\npresident of the United States?",

        "content": "Recently, I watched a three-year-old boy trail his mother and father slowly\r\nthrough a crowded airport. He was screaming violently at five-second intervals\r\n\u2014and, more important, he was doing it voluntarily. He wasn\u2019t at the end of this\r\ntether. As a parent, I could tell from the tone. He was irritating his parents and\r\nhundreds of other people to gain attention. Maybe he needed something. But that\r\nwas no way to get it, and his parents should have let him know that. You might\r\nobject that \u201cperhaps they were worn out, and jet-lagged, after a long trip.\u201d But\r\nthirty seconds of carefully directed problem-solving would have brought the\r\nshameful episode to a halt. More thoughtful parents would not have let someone\r\nthey truly cared for become the object of a crowd\u2019s contempt.\r\nI have also watched a couple, unable or unwilling to say no to their two-yearold, obliged to follow closely behind him everywhere he went, every moment of\r\nwhat was supposed to be an enjoyable social visit, because he misbehaved so\r\nbadly when not micro-managed that he could not be given a second of genuine\r\nfreedom without risk. The desire of his parents to let their child act without\r\ncorrection on every impulse perversely produced precisely the opposite effect:\r\nthey deprived him instead of every opportunity to engage in independent action.\r\nBecause they did not dare to teach him what \u201cNo\u201d means, he had no conception\r\nof the reasonable limits enabling maximal toddler autonomy. It was a classic\r\nexample of too much chaos breeding too much order (and the inevitablereversal). I have, similarly, seen parents rendered unable to engage in adult\r\nconversation at a dinner party because their children, four and five, dominated\r\nthe social scene, eating the centres out of all the sliced bread, subjecting\r\neveryone to their juvenile tyranny, while mom and dad watched, embarrassed\r\nand bereft of the ability to intervene",

        "content": "It does not seem reasonable to describe the young man who shot twenty children\r\nand six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,\r\nConnecticut, in 2012 as a religious person. This is equally true for the Colorado\r\ntheatre gunman and the Columbine High School killers. But these murderous\r\nindividuals had a problem with reality that existed at a religious depth. As one of\r\nthe members of the Columbine duo wrote:108\r\nThe human race isn\u2019t worth fighting for, only worth killing. Give the Earth back to the animals.\r\nThey deserve it infinitely more than we do. Nothing means anything anymore.\r\nPeople who think such things view Being itself as inequitable and harsh to the\r\npoint of corruption, and human Being, in particular, as contemptible. They\r\nappoint themselves supreme adjudicators of reality and find it wanting. They are\r\nthe ultimate critics. The deeply cynical writer continues:\r\nIf you recall your history, the Nazis came up with a \u201cfinal solution\u201d to the Jewish problem.\u2026\r\nKill them all. Well, in case you haven\u2019t figured it out, I say \u201cKILL MANKIND.\u201d No one should\r\nsurvive.\r\nFor such individuals, the world of experience is insufficient and evil\u2014so to hell\r\nwith everything!\r\nWhat is happening when someone comes to think in this manner? A great\r\nGerman play, Faust: A Tragedy, written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,addresses that issue. The play\u2019s main character, a scholar named Heinrich Faust,\r\ntrades his immortal soul to the devil, Mephistopheles. In return, he receives\r\nwhatever he desires while still alive on Earth. In Goethe\u2019s play, Mephistopheles\r\nis the eternal adversary of Being. He has a central, defining credo:109\r\nI am the spirit who negates\r\nand rightly so, for all that comes to be\r\ndeserves to perish, wretchedly.\r\nIt were better nothing would begin!\r\nThus everything that your terms sin,\r\ndestruction, evil represent\u2014\r\nthat is my proper element.\r\nGoethe considered this hateful sentiment so important\u2014so key to the central\r\nelement of vengeful human destructiveness\u2014that he had Mephistopheles say it a\r\nsecond time, phrased somewhat differently, in Part II of the play, written many\r\nyears later.",

        "content": "Life is suffering. That\u2019s clear. There is no more basic, irrefutable truth. It\u2019s\r\nbasically what God tells Adam and Eve, immediately before he kicks them out\r\nof Paradise.\r\nUnto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou\r\nshalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\r\nAnd unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast\r\neaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the\r\nground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;\r\nThorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;\r\nBy the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it\r\nyou were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.\u201d (Genesis 3:16-19. KJV)\r\nWhat in the world should be done about that?\r\nThe simplest, most obvious, and most direct answer? Pursue pleasure. Follow\r\nyour impulses. Live for the moment. Do what\u2019s expedient. Lie, cheat, steal,\r\ndeceive, manipulate\u2014but don\u2019t get caught. In an ultimately meaningless\r\nuniverse, what possible difference could it make? And this is by no means a new\r\nidea. The fact of life\u2019s tragedy and the suffering that is part of it has been used to\r\njustify the pursuit of immediate selfish gratification for a very long time.\r\nShort and sorrowful is our life, and there is no remedy when a man comes to his end, and no one\r\nhas been known to return from Hades.Because we were born by mere chance, and hereafter we shall be as though we had never\r\nbeen; because the breath in our nostrils is smoke, and reason is a spark kindled by the beating of\r\nour hearts.\r\nWhen it is extinguished, the body will turn to ashes, and the spirit will dissolve like empty air.\r\nOur name will be forgotten in time and no one will remember our works; our life will pass away\r\nlike the traces of a cloud, and be scattered like mist that is chased by the rays of the sun and\r\novercome by its heat.\r\nFor our allotted time is the passing of a shadow, and there is no return from our death,\r\nbecause it is sealed up and no one turns back.\r\nCome, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that exist, and make use of the creation to the\r\nfull as in youth.\r\nLet us take our fill of costly wine and perfumes, and let no flower of spring pass by us.\r\nLet us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither.\r\nLet none of us fail to share in our revelry, everywhere let us leave signs of enjoyment,\r\nbecause this is our portion, and this our lot.\r\nLet us oppress the righteous poor man; let us not spare the widow nor regard the gray hairs of\r\nthe aged.\r\nBut let our might be our law of right, for what is weak proves itself to be useless.

        "content": "I trained to become a clinical psychologist at McGill University, in Montreal.\r\nWhile doing so, I sometimes met my classmates on the grounds of Montreal\u2019s\r\nDouglas Hospital, where we had our first direct experiences with the mentally\r\nill. The Douglas occupies acres of land and dozens of buildings. Many are\r\nconnected by underground tunnels to protect workers and patients from the\r\ninterminable Montreal winters. The hospital once sheltered hundreds of longterm in-house patients. This was before anti-psychotic drugs and the large scale\r\ndeinstitutionalization movements of the late sixties all but closed down the\r\nresidential asylums, most often dooming the now \u201cfreed\u201d patients to a much\r\nharder life on the streets. By the early eighties, when I first visited the grounds,\r\nall but the most seriously afflicted residents had been discharged. Those who\r\nremained were strange, much-damaged people. They clustered around the\r\nvending machines scattered throughout the hospital\u2019s tunnels. They looked as if\r\nthey had been photographed by Diane Arbus or painted by Hieronymus Bosch.\r\nOne day my classmates and I were all standing in line. We were awaiting\r\nfurther instruction from the strait-laced German psychologist who ran the\r\nDouglas clinical training program. A long-term inpatient, fragile and vulnerable,\r\napproached one of the other students, a sheltered, conservative young woman.\r\nThe patient spoke to her in a friendly, childlike manner, and asked, \u201cWhy are\r\nyou all standing here? What are you doing? Can I come along with you?\u201d My\r\nclassmate turned to me and asked uncertainly, \u201cWhat should I say to her?\u201d Shewas taken aback, just as I was, by this request coming from someone so isolated\r\nand hurt. Neither of us wanted to say anything that might be construed as a\r\nrejection or reprimand.\r\nWe had temporarily entered a kind of no-man\u2019s-land, in which society offers\r\nno ground rules or guidance. We were new clinical students, unprepared to be\r\nconfronted on the grounds of a mental hospital by a schizophrenic patient asking\r\na naive, friendly question about the possibility of social belonging. The natural\r\nconversational give-and-take between people attentive to contextual cues was\r\nnot happening here, either. What exactly were the rules, in such a situation, far\r\noutside the boundaries of normal social interaction? What exactly were the\r\noptions?",

They were known as\r\nGerman spitzes until the First World War made it verboten to admit that anything\r\ngood could come from Germany. American Eskimos are among the most\r\nbeautiful of dogs, with a pointed, classic wolf face, upright ears, a long thick\r\ncoat, and a curly tail. They are also very intelligent. Our dog, whose name is\r\nSikko (which means \u201cice\u201d in an Inuit language, according to my daughter, who\r\nnamed him), learns tricks very rapidly, and can do so even now that he\u2019s old.
