Nonetheless, even with the second perceptions\r\nincluded, what are you seeing is hardly the computer at all. That grey and black\r\nbox happens to be a computer right now, right here and now, and maybe even an\r\nexpensive computer. Nevertheless, it will soon be something so unlike a\r\ncomputer that it will be difficult even to give away.\r\nWe will all discard our laptops within the next five years, even though they\r\nmay still work perfectly\u2014even though the screens, keyboards, mice and internet\r\nconnections may still flawlessly perform their tasks. Fifty years from now, early\r\ntwenty-first-century laptops will be oddities like the brass scientific tools of the\r\nlate nineteenth century. The latter now appear more like the arcane\r\naccoutrements of alchemy, designed to measure phenomena whose existence we\r\nno longer even recognize. How can high-tech machines, each possessing more\r\ncomputing power than the entire Apollo space program, lose their value in such\r\na short period of time? How can they transform so quickly from exciting, useful\r\nand status-enhancing machines to complex pieces of junk? It\u2019s because of the\r\nnature of our perceptions themselves, and the oft-invisible interaction between\r\nthose perceptions and the underlying complexity of the world", "anonymous": true, "date_posted": "2020-04-26T21:03:22.218Z", "author": 1}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 15, "fields": {"title": "DO NOT BOTHER CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE SKATEBOARDING", "content": "There was a time when kids skateboarded on the west side of Sidney Smith Hall,\r\nat the University of Toronto, where I work.

There are rough, wide, shallow concrete steps there, leading up from the\r\nstreet to the front entrance, accompanied by tubular iron handrails, about two\r\nand a half inches in diameter and twenty feet long. The crazy kids, almost\r\nalways boys, would pull back about fifteen yards from the top of the steps.

Either way, they were\r\nsoon back at it.\r\nSome might call that stupid. Maybe it was. But it was brave, too. I thought\r\nthose kids were amazing. I thought they deserved a pat on the back and some\r\nhonest admiration. Of course it was dangerous. Danger was the point. They\r\nwanted to triumph over danger. They would have been safer in protective\r\nequipment, but that would have ruined it. They weren\u2019t trying to be safe.

They were known as\r\nGerman spitzes until the First World War made it verboten to admit that anything\r\ngood could come from Germany. American Eskimos are among the most\r\nbeautiful of dogs, with a pointed, classic wolf face, upright ears, a long thick\r\ncoat, and a curly tail. They are also very intelligent. Our dog, whose name is\r\nSikko (which means \u201cice\u201d in an Inuit language, according to my daughter, who\r\nnamed him), learns tricks very rapidly, and can do so even now that he\u2019s old. I\r\ntaught him a new stunt, recently, when he turned thirteen. He already knew how\r\nto shake a paw, and to balance a treat on his nose. I taught him to do both at the\r\nsame time. However, it\u2019s not at all clear he enjoys it.\r\nWe bought Sikko for my daughter, Mikhaila, when she was about ten years\r\nold. He was an unbearably cute pup. Small nose and ears, rounded face, big\r\neyes, awkward movements\u2014these features automatically elicit caretaking\r\nbehaviour from humans, male and female alike.208 This was certainly the case\r\nwith Mikhaila, who was also occupied with the care of bearded dragons,\r\ngekkoes, ball pythons, chameleons, iguanas and a twenty-pound, thirty-twoinch-long Flemish Giant rabbit named George, who nibbled on everything in the\r\nhouse and frequently escaped (to the great consternation of those who then spiedhis improbably large form in their tiny mid-city gardens). She had all these\r\nanimals because she was allergic to the more typical pets\u2014excepting Sikko, who\r\nhad the additional advantage of being hypo-allergenic", "anonymous": true, "date_posted": "2020-04-26T21:04:44.512Z", "author": 1}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 17, "fields": {"title": "Blog 2", "content": "One neat thing about the Bible story is that it doesn\u2019t simply list its rules, as\r\nlawyers or legislators or administrators might; it embeds them in a dramatic tale\r\nthat illustrates why we need them, thereby making them easier to understand.\r\nSimilarly, in this book Professor Peterson doesn\u2019t just propose his twelve rules,\r\nhe tells stories, too, bringing to bear his knowledge of many fields as he\r\nillustrates and explains why the best rules do not ultimately restrict us but\r\ninstead facilitate our goals and make for fuller, freer lives.", "anonymous": true, "date_posted": "2020-04-26T21:08:05.209Z", "author": 2}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 18, "fields": {"title": "Blog 3", "content": "The first time I met Jordan Peterson was on September 12, 2004, at the home of\r\ntwo mutual friends, TV producer Wodek Szemberg and medical internist Estera\r\nBekier.
